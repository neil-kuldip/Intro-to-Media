            You as the player are situated in your car, driving down a road at night. Maybe not such a wise decision given that you drank a 
            little too much and wind up crashing the car into a nearby tree. The decisions to save yourself starts here, with a demon on the 
            loose nearby where you crashed. There are 4 different endings, but who knows if any of them would be satisfying enough. Point is, 
            you don't know where you are, and are making quick rational decisions to figure out the best course of action. As the creator, I am
            allowing you to interact with certain objects and moving around to different areas when asked to.
