      Reading Tetteh’s heart-wrenching story without the illustration would not be as impactful and revealing 
      of the suffering and pain she’s been through. The illustrations doesn’t only give a sense of the harsh 
      environment in the correctional center in Sierra Leone, but also depicts Tetteh’s backstory in her 
      perspective. It captures the trauma and what she regrets from the time with her husband before his death. 
      The use of light and shadow draws in the solitude of dealing with the pain alone and the scenes of 
      comparison with the same subject in different lights produces a sense of foreshadowing photographs 
      aren’t able to produce. Text and photography only would have made the story feel like a tragic documentary. 
      This graphic novel constructs moments of her life that we as the reader have the ability to take a glimpse 
      into. This makes her story more human than just a simple article, it portrays her journey and the emphasis 
      on the need for her to be able to see her child, Alie, again.
