      Experimenting with the DSLR, I wanted to try taking a photo of something that was the central focus of 
      the setting. However, I wanted that focus to shape the perspective of the adjacent area, which led me to 
      taking the photo of this lit candle. After taking this photo it dawned on me how the candle symbolizes 
      oneâ€™s own first-person perspective on the world and how our own vision shapes the way we view our own 
      environment like that of the candle. At the same time, the duration of time this candle can stay lit is 
      finite, just like ourselves and how we spend our time to illuminate pathways that are the most important 
      to us. I used Photoshop to add adjustment level and saturation/hue layers to show more of the candle wick 
      and lighting the background a bit more.
