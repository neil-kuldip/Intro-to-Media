      When I took this photo, I was only amazed at how the body grew differently from the surrounding trees. 
      There were others that were the same species as this tree but didn't have that "twisted" bark pattern 
      that intrigued me so much. However, as to why I chose this photo was because it relates to my perspective 
      of time at a glance. Day by day we don't come to realize the little changes in ourselves, where time is 
      usually scoped by yesterday, today, and tomorrow's changes. If we take that step back and view how much 
      we actually changed, we might be surprised to see how different we came to be like this tree. I used 
      Photoshop to add adjustment level and saturation layers to bring out the details of the bark.
