        When lockdown started, I remembered vividly the green leaves that had taken 
        form in my nearby park. The day I had finally left my home during lockdown’s 
        ease, there were barely any leaves left on the trees. The months in-between 
        felt like years, but at the same time they felt like glimpses into fear, 
        anxiety, and wondering when things could begin to feel normal again. 
        Small parts like not devoting time to taking the subway and having to find 
        a quiet place in my home for classes were the early obstacles. The harder 
        challenge was getting accustomed to sitting in a chair for hours on end. 
        The changing time on my alarm clock soon began to lose its meaning, only 
        signifying when I can give my eyes a rest.

    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">    
        From there I had bought a calendar to strike off the passing days and write 
        deadlines. That routine I had made for myself was my grip of time, trying my 
        best to focus on the here and now. The way how I would visually represent 
        notions of time may be an out of focus shot of my alarm clock or an 
        illustration of a tilted calendar. The calendar would be filled with 
        annotations for the first fews weeks and then completely blank after. 
        I would like to convey the idea of how much effort it is to keep up with time 
        and being in the present. I could also try to do a timelapse image of the sun’s 
        path through my window. I’ve noticed that during days of quarantine, I would 
        be in my chair from morning to night but never notice the progression of time 
        from the outside. While in isolation, it was an interesting way to perceive 
        each day as it comes and goes.
