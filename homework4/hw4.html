    For the first photomontage which I call, “Greed’s Apathy,” represents how capitalism is one of the main problems
    in industrialized society. Specifically in the U.S., where the difference in economic status is so distinct and 
    intense, money not only gives one power but also a newfound greed and distorted perspective on others. I try to 
    accomplish this through the figure in this work, the Capitalist man, who walks around the city square with a 
    disregard for the homeless people surrounding him. Blinded with a Starbucks bag over his head, he moves forward 
    thinking about what next to do with his wealth. The money flying away from him is all that he spends so far, 
    but note that none of those banknotes will ever reach the lower class lying on the floor. In Photoshop, I 
    modified the hue and saturation of the figures in adjustment layers and clipping masks to fit the dark setting. 
    I also overlaid the city image over a nebula background with a lower opacity to give the city a distinct blue 
    smoke. Then I created a field blur for the things behind the Capitalist man for shallow depth of field. All 
    these photos were taken from Unsplash Creative Commons images.

    This second work, “Indifference to Destruction,” portrays the average congressperson or lobbyist who claims the 
    climate crisis is a hoax to further push their agendas. The destruction this entails for the environment is 
    widely apparent, but if one of these people were to view it with their own eyes they would have no concern to 
    change their actions. This photomontage tries to capture this heartless point-of-view through the combination 
    of images of environmental disasters and the back of the decision-maker’s head. In Photoshop, I overlaid images 
    of the melting iceberg, burning forest, and rising skyscrapers in adjustment layers. The skyscrapers are above 
    the rest since industry and business holds more importance than the environment. I also blended the figures to 
    have a similar color shade as the smoke in the sky with the black and white adjustment layer and increasing the 
    yellow and cyan values. Finally I used a hard light on the decision-maker to represent the indifference. These 
    photos were taken from Unsplash and Pixabay Creative Commons images.
