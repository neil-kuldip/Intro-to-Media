        When I first interacted with Abramović’s website, I was already interested by the warm but dark atmosphere 
        that the beginning page gave off. From the description I was confused by the meaning of “transfer of energy”, 
        but at that point I generalized that meant human connection and a metaphysical sense of living from context. 
        My state of confusion instantly became curiosity after I was taken to the main site with the five images. I 
        was thinking to myself, “We have a quartz crystal, a stone from Mars, a flower that I never heard of, a painting 
        I can’t ever forget, but why a photograph?” I already decided that the quartz looked the most interesting so that 
        would be the first object to explore. It wasn’t until after experiencing all of the traces that it occurred to me 
        that maybe my reactions and experiences to the exhibit would’ve been different if I took a different path. However, 
        I believe that just proves Abramović’s work to have expressed those sensory feelings of wonder and questioning our 
        human experience.

        Entering the <i>Quartz Stones</i>, the background music and the revolving quartz crystals was somewhat expected but that 
        didn’t diminish the feeling I had from the overall first part of the experience. Moving the crystal around, I began 
        to understand her description of how the crystal can make you feel more connected to the Earth. At times when I have 
        those shower thoughts, it does come to mind that I overthink my day-to-day assignments, activities, and routines to 
        get by. Sitting down and clearing my mind to open myself to the untapped connections may sound like a luxury, but it’s 
        an experience if we make the active decision to indulge in it. I enjoyed reading her stories associated with the quartz 
        crystal, and it made me feel a part of the experience she wanted to express with this work. I don’t have to be in 
        Amsterdam and sitting on crystal pillows to feel the point she was getting across because it’s there all around us. 
        To us time is relative, but it is also a factor of our experiences. The more we give our time to these moments, the more 
        we get out of them and the more we remember the lessons from them.

        Looking into <i>A Stone From Mars</i>, I was starting to draw connections from the quartz stone section. When I first thought 
        of this bigger picture experience, my mind instantly went to space. It’s a huge bulk of our physical existence that we 
        don’t know much of nor do we have that much progress to close the gaps on what we don’t know. Playing with the stone, I 
        found myself caught up in the part that looked like a piece was broken off. I don’t think Abramović did this intentionally, 
        but it made me think of how much we’ve come in exploration of space to figure out the components of these rocks and how 
        different and alike our planet is to them. I related to the prompt for this section more so than the quartz in that we’re 
        always drawn to focus on the short-term stuff rather than the long-term. Still, given our more interconnected and demanding 
        society, it seems that the window of opportunity to look at the bigger picture is always getting smaller. Thinking further 
        about, “How can we say we truly understand the cause and effects of our lives on this planet?” my train of thought splits 
        in half. On one side, I believe that where humanity is at the frontiers of science will surely one day bring us to a new 
        plane of realization and comprehension. It will surely take centuries, but sure enough we will eventually understand our 
        place with all its causes and effects on the planet. Yet, that is still quite a long time to await those answers. It’s 
        beyond our lifetimes to ever experience that bundle of knowledge. What I definitely agree with is the way she situated the 
        rock as a medium for experiencing the big picture. Thoughts are one thing, but the physical experience of the thing we’re 
        so curious has more profound weight to the whole concept.

            <i>The Starry Night</i> was by far the most amazing exhibit out of all of them. Before this, I never actually thought of Van Gogh 
            expressing his perception of reality through this masterpiece. It was always an amazing impressionist outlook on a beautiful 
            view from his window, but this takes the cake on the connection to the theme of the bigger picture. By clicking and holding, 
            the painting coming close to an atomic-appearing level was astounding. That relationship between the impressionist dots and 
            atomic particles was demonstrated with ease. As Abramović said, this section really made me physically react faster than my 
            mind could. It’s not every day that you encounter something that pushes you to look at a different version of reality. It 
            came to mind if so many people copied Van Gogh’s art and made different versions of his idea, then his art succeeded in 
            resonating with them enough that they pursued to try to build on his excellence. There’s many wonderful pieces of art, 
            but <i>The Starry Night</i> never fails to impress me. Hopefully Abramović's idea of a room alone with headphones and this artwork 
            comes to fruition, because I am certain I would want to try it out.

            Moving onto the <i>Rose of Jericho</i> and <i>Regaining The Pain of Others</i>, this was something that I thought the theme of connection 
            and the bigger picture was missing. We live on a planet with almost eight billion other people, but general ideas of conflict 
            and suffering never end. Like the flower, the ability to have resistance to life’s problems is important and should be encouraged 
            that everyone learns it. Not every day will be a positive one, but in our finite lifespan the positive ones are the ones we should 
            appreciate the most. Coming back to the rose’s section, the flower animation was very trippy, but it was intriguing how many chances 
            a given Rose of Jericho has to bloom. The Pain of Others section was the most heart-wrenching to experience, with the photographs 
            putting into perspective the harsh realities that many of us are fortunate to not experience. We are not inescapable from pain, sickness, 
            and the actions of others, but to sympathize and empathize with those in pain is powerful. To be able to give some part of ourselves to 
            others in a low point of their lives may give them a profound sense of living and maybe a new lens of purpose. I am grateful to have engaged 
            with this work of art and writing this review gave me the opportunity to express my thoughts on the work on a more satisfying level.
