        Watching Nathan Fowkes’ session was almost completely different from what I had expected it to be. 
        Before, my only exposure to Photoshop and Adobe software tools was through this class. With the 
        assignments, I came to perceive Photoshop as the go-to software for photo manipulation and editing 
        but I realized my lack of insight on how it can be used for digital painting. In the lectures, we 
        have learned how the tools and techniques implemented in Photoshop are inspired from that of traditional 
        painting and design. However, Fowkes’ real-time demonstration of painting luminous colors really 
        solidified my understanding of this. It presented me with a new perspective of what it means to be a 
        digital painter. As it may seem that the tools are conveniently there for our use, it’s an important 
        thing to have an idea in mind of how and when we should use these instruments. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
        Luminosity is the effect created from the optical mixture of colors to produce that sense of vibration 
        and warmth in painting. Fowkes referenced Georges Pierre Sarut’s famous work, “A Sunday on La Grande 
        Jatte,” for Sarut’s creativity in producing luminosity through pointillism. It bewildered me how someone 
        can spend two years meticulously painting lines and dots to produce such a scenery. That bewilderment 
        turned to amazement when Fowkes zoomed in on the artwork to show a particular section’s colors blended 
        together. In that up close view, it didn’t make much sense since the pattern wasn’t apparent. Slowly 
        inching back to the overview allowed me to see what Serut has aimed for through his extensive work. 
        It’s not just visualizing the overall pattern, but to mimic what actual light does when it touches the 
        surface and changes our outlook on the area. Sarut’s technique was so powerful that other impressionist 
        artists in the same time period found that this way of painting allowed them to accurately portray what 
        they wanted out of the landscape. It then occurred to me how painting is an ever-evolving field where new 
        modes of expression will be discovered and reflective of how we want to see our environments.

        In the same light, this session also had me lost in thought of how I can apply this into what future 
        works I will make in and out of Photoshop. When using the brush tool in Photoshop, I basically only changed 
        the brush size and sometimes its shape. Only through tutorial videos did I find the sense of courage to want 
        to try different settings. I felt as if I tried a new setting in this complex software, I might end up 
        making a disaster and stray further away from what I intended to make. While I still may be nervous when 
        using Photoshop, the tutorial video allowed me to see how a trained professional utilizes Photoshop in ways 
        I never thought of. Specifically for Fowkes’ session I learned about color dynamics and how concepts like 
        hue and saturation extends to this setting. By applying hue jitter, which changes the color of the brush 
        in each stroke, and stroke spacing, I can achieve the bright, warm atmosphere that I want to express. 
        I believe with this concept I have a new way to explore how to reflect the moon’s light onto surfaces at 
        night, draw a mountain or canyon range at different times of the day, or even human interaction with a near 
        or distant light source framing the scene with digital painting. While this session may have been aimed for 
        intermediate Photoshop users, I feel as if it gave me a step up in becoming aware of the possible and 
        feeding my curiosity to achieve it.
